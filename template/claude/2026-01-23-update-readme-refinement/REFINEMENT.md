# Project Refinement

Explain the 'refinement' skill in the README. 

## Type of Refinement

- [ ] Code refactoring (improve internal structure)
- [ ] Reorganization (move files, restructure directories)
- [ ] Global renaming (rename functions, classes, variables)
- [ ] Code cleanup (remove unused code, improve consistency)
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [X] Other: Documentation update - add refinement skill to README

## What I Want to Refine

Add documentation about the refinement skill to the README file.

## Current Issues

The README doesn't mention the refinement skill, so users may not know it exists or how to use it.

## Desired Outcome

The README should include information about the refinement skill alongside the other skills (requirements, decisions, architecture, plan, implement).

Refinement should be offered as an alternative to the other developement skills. I recommend using the other
skills if you are creating a new product or script. The development track walks you through the steps 
that you'll have to dive deep on in order to have a full feature developed. 

Sometimes, you want to do something to your repository which isn't as heavy handed as creating a whole new feature.
For instance, you might want to create a document. In that case, you still want to have a conversation with 
claude, but you don't need to be asked about design decisions. 

Refinement is a streamlined approach to writing docs, refactoring, renaming, or code clean up. 

## Scope

- README.md file(s) that document available skills
- Potentially related documentation files

## Constraints

- Maintain existing README structure and tone
- Be consistent with how other skills are documented
- Don't break any existing links or references

**Next Step**: Once you've filled this out, tell Claude you're ready to proceed.
