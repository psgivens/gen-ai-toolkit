# Refinement Questions

Based on your REFINEMENT.md, I have clarifying questions about how to document the refinement skill in the README.

## 1. Placement in README Structure

The README has several logical sections. Where should refinement documentation go?

**Options:**
- Add a new top-level section "Alternative Workflow: Refinement" before "The Five Phases"
- Add as a subsection under "What Is This?" alongside the five phases
- Add a new section after "The Five Phases" called "When to Use Refinement Instead"
- Other placement suggestion

**Your answer:**
You'll have to restructure the file to offer the development activity and the refinment activity. 
The Five Phases would live under the development activity. The only skill under the refinement activity
is refinement. 

Perhaps we mention the refinment activity and skill in "what is this", then talk about the development activity,
then talk about the refinement activity. 



## 2. Level of Detail

How much detail should we provide about refinement in the main README?

**Options:**
- Brief overview (2-3 paragraphs) with a link to refinement skill.md
- Full detailed walkthrough similar to the 5-phase descriptions
- Comparison table showing when to use refinement vs. development workflow
- Minimal mention with primary documentation elsewhere

**Your answer:**
- Full detailed walkthrough, but since it is only one skill, it will be simpler than the 5-phase descriptions
- Guidance as to when to use refinement vs. development workflow


## 3. When to Use Refinement

You mentioned refinement is for "lighter-weight tasks". Should we provide specific examples or decision criteria?

**Examples to include:**
- Creating/updating documentation
- Refactoring existing code
- Global renaming (variables, functions, classes)
- Code cleanup
- Other examples?

**Your answer:**
The provided examples are good. 



## 4. Relationship to Development Workflow

How should we position refinement relative to the 5-phase workflow?

**Messaging options:**
- "Alternative workflow for non-feature work"
- "Streamlined approach for maintenance tasks"
- "Skip the heavy planning when you know what you need"
- Other framing?

**Your answer:**
- "Streamlined approach for maintenance tasks"


## 5. Skills Table Update

The README has a "Skills Reference" table listing the 5 development skills. Should refinement be added to this table?

**Options:**
- Add refinement as a 6th row in the existing table
- Create a separate table for "Alternative Skills"
- Don't add to table, document separately
- Create a decision tree or flowchart for choosing skills

**Your answer:**
Yes, add it to the table, but we need a new column to talk about development vs refinement activities. 



## 6. Additional information

Refinement is good when you still want to have claude ask you questions, create a plan, and then execute. 
This allows you to make decisions and evaluate what claude will do before it does it.
