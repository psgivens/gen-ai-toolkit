Implement workflow improvements and codebase documentation standards

Major additions:
- Add documentation workflow creating both user and codebase docs
- Add templates: ADR, ARCHITECTURE, CLAUDE_PROJECT (for docs/CLAUDE.md)
- Add documentation philosophy and standards to README and PATTERNS

Design workflow enhancements:
- Discover existing patterns before asking questions (EXISTING_PATTERNS.md)
- Reference design tenets from MISSION.md in recommendations
- Add confidence levels (✓✓✓/✓✓/✓) to all recommendations
- Prompt for ADRs after significant architectural decisions
- Update/create living ARCHITECTURE.md at project root

Architecture & plan workflows:
- Remove interview phases, generate documents directly
- Architecture reads requirements/design/tenets, creates ARCHITECTURE.md
- Plan reads architecture, breaks into implementation steps
- Both workflows maintain review gates for iteration

Requirements workflow:
- Add design tenets section to MISSION.md template
- Tenets guide design trade-offs (e.g., "Robustness over performance")

PATTERNS.md additions:
- Clarify 'iterate' command meaning (explicit instructions)
- Add research spike pattern for pausing interviews
- Add documentation standards (what to document, what to avoid)
- Update document review prompts (conversational, not command-based)

Templates created:
- ADR_TEMPLATE.md: Architecture Decision Records in docs/adrs/
- ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md: Living architecture doc with entry points
- CLAUDE_PROJECT_TEMPLATE.md: Project guidelines for docs/CLAUDE.md

Documentation locations standardized:
- User docs: docs/
- Codebase docs: docs/code/
- Project guidelines: docs/CLAUDE.md
- ADRs: docs/adrs/
- Living architecture: ARCHITECTURE.md (at root)

Backlog updates:
- Defer roadmap/backlog workflow to v1.5
- Defer scope breakdown recommendations to v1.5
- Defer testing guidance (Ralph Wiggum Loop) to v1.5

Based on principles from claude/CLAUDE_PREP.md for efficient codebase navigation.
